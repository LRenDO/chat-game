# Chat Game

This project was developed for an introduction to computer networks course. 
It is a text base chat game to demonstrate sockets and client/server 
interaction. The main file is ChatSocket.py. 

Right now, it is set to run basic tic tac toe, but it can be easily switched 
by importing ChatMegaGame.py instead of ChatGame.py. Mega chat game has 9 
tic tac toe boards and you have to win on 3 of them in a row.
